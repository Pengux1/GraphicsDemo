                <p><strong>Eustress</strong> is a postitive psychological response to a stressor, as indicated by the presence of positive psychological stares such as feelinf enthusiastic and motivaed, excited, active and alert. Eustres is typically short-term, and can provide the energy and motivation to achieve a goal or peak performance, and is not harmful or damaging to the body
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Distress</strong> is a negative psychological response to a stressor, as indicated by the presence of negative psychological states such as anger, anxiety, nervousness, irritability or tension. Prolonged distress can have serious and debilitating consequences for our physical and mental health.</p>
                <p class="note">Basically, Eustress is good stress, Distress is bad stress.</p>
                
                <p>All stressors(Things that produce stress), produce a <i>non-specific</i> stress response. Regardless of whether a stressor involves eustress or distress, the body undergoes virtually the same physiological changes. However, an individual will experience it as negative or postitive depending on their personal values and past experience.</p>

                <h4 class="page-header">Flight-Fight-Freeze Response</h4>
                
                <p>The fight–flight–freeze response is an involuntary, physical response to a sudden and immediate threat (or stressor) in readiness to:</p>
                <p>•	Fight — Confronting and fighting off the threat.</p>
                <p>•	Flight — Escaping by running away to safety.</p>
                <p>•	Freeze — Keeping absolutely still and silent, avoiding detection.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Flight-Fight Reactions</h4>
                
                <p>When ones wellbeing is threatened, two immediate ooptions are to either fight off the threat or escape from it. To prepare the body for either alternative, all energy is directed from non-essential body systems to those systems that will help us either 'outrun' or 'outfight' the threat. Both reactions are initated by the sympathetic nervous system, and involve changes such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>•	Increased heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
                    <li>•	Redistribution of blood supply from the skin and intestines to the muscles.</li>
                    <li>•	Increased breathing rate (to increase oxygen supply). </li>
                    <li>•	Increased glucose secretion by the liver (for energy).</li>
                    <li>•	Dilation of the pupils (so the eyes can take in as much light as possible).</li>
                    <li>•	Suppression of functions that are not immediately essential in order to conserve energy (such as digestion and sexual drive) and which can be delayed without damage to the organism. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note">I would say remember three of these.</p>
                
                <p>When a threat is perceived, a signal is sent to the hypothalamus via the <a href="http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-amygdala-definition-role-function.html">amygdala</a>. It responds to the stressor by by activating the sympathetic nervous system, which then stimulates the adrenal medulla. This is the inner part of the adrenal gland, located about each kidney, which secretes catecholamines(hormones) into the bloodstream. Two of these hormones are <i>adrenaline</i> and <i>noradrenaline</i>, stress hormones that circulate in the bloodstream resulting in bodily changes that characterise the fight and flight reactions. The flight-fight reactions will enable one to fight harder, run faster, see better and breathe easier.</p>
                
                <p>Once the stressor is removed, the parasympathetic becomes dominant, and high body arousal subsides.</p>
                
                <p class="note">Basically, the hypothalamus receives a signal when a threat is seen, the sympathetic nervous system kicks in, and allows the person to extert themselves more.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Freeze Reactions</h4>
                
                <p>A freeze reaction occurs when faced with a threat that is so overwhelming that there is little or no chance of successfully fighting or escaping.</p>
                
                <p>Body movements and vocalisations stop, the racing eart slows down significantly, blood pressure drops and tense muscles collapse and become very still. Usually, there is a relexive 'oruenting response' of the head or eyes to the direction of the threat, accompanied by hypervigilance(Being on guard, watchful or extremely alert). This inital part of the freeze response acan be described as 'stop, look and listen' behaviour in response to fear.</p>
                
                <p>It is believed that this is done to assess the situation before making a next move. However some psychologists believe that this is not a true freeze state because the mind can become numb during a freeze state.</p>
                
                <p>The immobility of the freeze state is considered to have some adaptive value, as  prey that remain 'frozen' during a threat are more likely to avoid detection. The freeze state can also conserve energy, to be used for escape later. However it is not always adaptive, when the freeze reaction occurs during a non-threatening fearful event(eg. Freezing during a job interview)</p>
                
                
                <p>The biological processes underlying the freeze state are not completely understood. It is believed that sympathetic nervous system activation always precedes the freeze state and becomes part of this state. When the freeze reaction is initated the energy conserving 'rest and relaxation' actions of the parasympathetic nervous system dominate over the existing effects of the sympathetic activation. This leaves the organism in a state of high arousal of both the sympathetic and parasympatheic systems, allowing the organism to both conserve energy and be ready for action. </p>
                
                <p class="note">Jeepers that's a lot of content. Basically, when an organism can't fight or run away, they enter the freeze state. The state allows the organism to assess their situation by stimulating both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Role of Cortisol</h4>
                
                <p>To deal with a stressor over a prolonged the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal) axis is activated, a brain-body pathway, as the body cannot maintain the flight-fight reactions for a pronlonged period of time. The hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland, which in turn secretes hormones, such as ACTH, which is carried to the adrenal cortex. This stimulates the release of corticosteroids, which are stress hormones. The most abundant of these hormones is Cortisol.</p>
                
                <p>Cortisol's main effect is to energise the body by increasing energy supplies such as blood sugar and enhancing metabolism. Cortisol also has an anti-inflamitory effect, by blocking the activity of white blood cells. However it also slows wound healing, overall suppressing the activity of the immune system.</p>
                
                <p>The HPA axis takes significantly longer then the flight-fight-freeze response(Seconds to minutes) and persists for much londer(minutes to hours), but has an overall effect simmilar to that of the fight or flight reactions. </p>
                
                <p>High levels of cortisol over a prolonged period have the effect of impared immune system functioning, physical health problems and some mental disorders.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome</h4>
                
                <p><strong>The General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)</strong> is a three-stage physiological response to stress that occurs regardless of the stressor that is encountered. This means that the GAS is non-specific and will occur whatever the source of the stressor. As shown in figure 3.24, the GAS consists of three stages: an alarm reaction stage (with shock and counter shock), a stage of resistance and a stage of exhaustion.</p>

                                    <p>When the organism first becomes aware of the stressor the body goes into a temporary state of <i>shock</i> and its ability to deal with a stressor below its normal level. Physically, the body acts as if it was injured, as blood pressure and body temperature drop, and a temporary loss of muscle tone is experienced. The body rebounds from this level with a reaction called <i>countershock</i>. During this reaction the sympathetic nervous system is activated and the body's resistance to a stressor increases, as the organsim undergoes a fight-flight response. The inital stage of GAs is a general defensive reaction to the stressor, and results in a state of tension and alertness, and a readiness to respond to the stressor.</p>

The bodies resistance to the particular stressor rises above normal. The intense arousal of the alarm reaction stage diminishes, but physiological arousal remains at a level above normal. Since the body is being taxed to generate resistance, all unnecessary physiological processes are shut down. Generally, if the effort to deal with the initial stressor during the resistance stage is successful, the organism will have adapted to the stressor and the body eventually returns to its normal ‘balanced’ (homeostatic) state of functioning.</p>

More commonly, the exhaustion stage brings about signs of physical wear and tear, especially in organs that have been consistently trying to deal with the stressor throughout the resistance stage.</p>

                <p>Selye's three stage GAS model of physiological responses to stress extended the findings of the flight-fight response, and further developed the links between stress and disease. The model also identifies biological processes associated with the body's stress response, such as the role in the GAS of the endocrine system. The model also identifies that the body can run out of resources to a persitent stressor, and become increasingly vulnerable.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Limitations</h4>
                
                <p>However the GAS is a 'one size fits all' model, and assumes that everyone will have the same gernal, predictable and automatic physiological responses to any kind of stressor. Consequencely, the GAS does not attempt to explain individual differences in terms of a response to a stressor. GAS tends to understate the roles of bodily systems other than the endocrine system, and does not address cognitive aspects of the stress response. Finally the GAS has been criticised for being primarily based on the results of research with animals.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Lazarus and Folkman’s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping</h4>
                
                <p><strong>The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping</strong> proposes that stres involves an encounter(transaction) between an individual and their external enviroment, and that a stress response depends upon the individuals interpretaion(appraisal) of the stressor and their ability to cope with it.</p>
                
                <p>According to this model, stress is not a result of the individual alone or the enviroment alone, as both can influence each other. Furthermore, an individual’s appraisal of the situation and their resources for dealing with that situation determine whether or not they experience stress and the nature of their stress response. When there is an imbalance between a person's appraisal of the situation and their estimation of how they can handle the situation, they will experience stress. Therefore, stress is a product of each individual's appraisal of a stressor, and largely individual and unique. Furthermore, the event which the individual has a transaction with will only lead to stress if they appraise the event as unpleasant. Appraisal is not necessarily a conscious process, but it is always subjective and therefore highly personal.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Primary and Secondary Appraisals</h4>
                
                <p>The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping distinguishes between two different types of appraisal of an event. These are called Primary Appraisal and Secondary Appraisal, and they occur in a two-step sequence in response to a potential stressor.</p>

                        <p>An individual evaluates the significance of the event, leading to a decision about whether the event is <i>irrelevant</i>, <i>benign-positive</i> or <i>stressful</i>. If the situation is decided to be harmful, threatening or challenging, additional apprasials are undertaken, involving:</p>
                        
                        <p>•	 <strong>Harm/Loss</strong> — An assessment of how much damage has already occurred (e.g. ‘I have lost my job’). </p>
                        <p>•	 <strong>Threat</strong> — An assessment of Harm/Loss that may not have yet occurred but could occur in the future (e.g. ‘I mightn’t be able to afford the rent’).</p>
                        <p>•	 <strong>Challenge</strong> — An assessment of the potential for personal gain or growth from the situation (e.g. ‘I’ll get any other job I can and will learn to budget and save money’). </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="page-header">Secondary Appraisal</h4>
                        
                        <p>An individual evaluates their coping options and resources, and theit options for dealing with the event. The coping options and resources available may be <i>internal</i>(eg. Determination) or <i>external</i>(eg. Support from family).</p>
                        
                        <p>If the coping demands of the situation are perceived as being greater than the resources that are available, then a stress response is likely to happen. The discrepancy that is perceived may also trigger a search for additional resources that can be used to cope with the stress.</p>

                <h4 class="page-header">Strengths and Limitations of the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping</h4>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Strengths</h4>
                
                <p>The Transactional model focuses on psychological influences on how one reacts to a stressor. It also emphasises the personal nature and individuality of the human stress response. Development of the model was also taken with reference to humans, not animals.</p>
                
                <p>The Transactional model views stress as involving an interaction with the enviroment in which the individual has an active rather than passive role. The role involves personal appraisals of a sitation, therefore emphasising each individual’s role in interpreting what that situation means to them from their perspective rather than from someone else’s. This allows for much more variability in the human stress response and helps explain why different individuals respond in different ways to the same stressor.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Limitations</h4>
                
                <p>The major limitation of the transactional model of stress and coping is that it is difficult to test through experimental research. This is mainly because of the subjective nature, variability and complexity of individual responses to stressful experiences. Furthermore, primary and secondary appraisals can interact with one another and are often undertaken simultaneously, making it hard to isolate for experimental purposes.</p>
                
                <p>Some psychologists also doubt that we actually need to appraise something as causing stress in order to have a stress response.</p>
                
                <p>Especially when compared with the GAS the model overlooks physiological responses to stressors.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Strategies for Coping with Stress</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Coping</strong> is a process involving 'cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific internal and/or external stressors that appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person’ in a stressful situation. When attempting to cope with a stressor, one will typically use one or more <strong>coping strategies</strong>, a specific method that people use to manage or reduce the stress produced by a stressor.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Context-Specific Effectiveness</h4>
                
                <p>In order for a coping stategy to be effective, it must take into account all of the characteristics of the stressful situation. A coping strategy is considered to have <strong>context-specific effectiveness</strong> when there is a match between the coping strategy that is used and the stressful situation. A stressful situation includes the enviroment the strategy is employed in, and the individual confronted with the stressor, and must match both to be effective.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Coping Flexibility</h4>
                
                <p>Most people have a number of coping strategies that they can use in times of stress, however the specific usage of these to match the situation is what makes them effective. The term <strong>coping flexibility</strong> to refer to the ability to effectively modify or adjust one's coping strategies according to the demands of different stressful situations. There are individual differences in coping flexibility. Some individuals have a higher level of coping flexibility than others. </p>

                <h4 class="page-header">Exercise</h4>
                
                <p>A physical activity that is usually planned and performed to improve or maintain one's physical condition. Higher levels of exercise tend to correlate with stress coping ability, and can therefore help counter stres reactions in the following ways:</p>
                
                <p>•	Physical exercise increases demands on the body for energy and in the process uses up the stress hormones.</p>
                <p>•	Exercise increases the efficiency of the cardiovascular system and increases strength, flexibility and stamina for encountering future stressors.</p>
                <p>•	Exercise can promote relaxation, thereby providing relief from stress symptoms. </p>
                <p>•	 Strenuous physical activity can produce chemical changes in the body that can improve psychological health. For example, the brain releases beta-endorphins during exercise, which relieve pain and increase a sense of wellbeing and relaxation.</p>
                <p>•	 Exercise can also provide an opportunity for distraction or ‘time out’ from a stressor.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Approach and Avoidance Coping Strategies</h4>

                    <div class="col-md-6 wow fadeInRight">
                        
                        <p>The strategies that people use to cope with stressors have been organised into different categories. In this system, the terms 'approach' and 'avoidance' are used to refer to the orientation or focus of an individuals activity either toward or away from the stressor.</p>
                
                        <h4 class="page-header">Approach Coping Strategies</h4>

                        <p>These involve efforts to confront a stressor and deal directly with it and its effects. Activity is focused <i>towards</i> the stressor, its causes and a solution that will address the underlying problem.</p>

                        <h4 class="page-header">Avoidant Coping Strategies</h4>

                        <p>These involve efforts that evade a stressor and deal indirectly with it and its effects. Activity is focused <i>away</i> from the stressor and there is no attempt to actively confront the stressor and its causes.</p>
                        
                        <p>Approach stategies are generally considered to be more adaptive and effective then avoidance strategies.  In addition, excessive reliance on avoidance strategies tends to be associated with a number of negative consequences, such as an increase in vulnerability to mental health problems and stress-related physical problems, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. </p>
                        
                        <p>Avoidant strategies can be more effective in coping with stress in the short term, and are not always maladaptive. Many stressors and stressful situations are actually quite complex, so both approach and avoidance strategies may be used for coping.</p>
