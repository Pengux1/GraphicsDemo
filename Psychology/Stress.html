                <p><strong>Eustress</strong> is a postitive psychological response to a stressor, as indicated by the presence of positive psychological stares such as feelinf enthusiastic and motivaed, excited, active and alert. Eustres is typically short-term, and can provide the energy and motivation to achieve a goal or peak performance, and is not harmful or damaging to the body
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Distress</strong> is a negative psychological response to a stressor, as indicated by the presence of negative psychological states such as anger, anxiety, nervousness, irritability or tension. Prolonged distress can have serious and debilitating consequences for our physical and mental health.</p>
                <p class="note">Basically, Eustress is good stress, Distress is bad stress.</p>
                
                <p>All stressors(Things that produce stress), produce a <i>non-specific</i> stress response. Regardless of whether a stressor involves eustress or distress, the body undergoes virtually the same physiological changes. However, an individual will experience it as negative or postitive depending on their personal values and past experience.</p>

                <h4 class="page-header">Flight-Fight-Freeze Response</h4>
                
                <p>The fight–flight–freeze response is an involuntary, physical response to a sudden and immediate threat (or stressor) in readiness to:</p>
                <p>•	Fight — Confronting and fighting off the threat.</p>
                <p>•	Flight — Escaping by running away to safety.</p>
                <p>•	Freeze — Keeping absolutely still and silent, avoiding detection.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Flight-Fight Reactions</h4>
                
                <p>When ones wellbeing is threatened, two immediate ooptions are to either fight off the threat or escape from it. To prepare the body for either alternative, all energy is directed from non-essential body systems to those systems that will help us either 'outrun' or 'outfight' the threat. Both reactions are initated by the sympathetic nervous system, and involve changes such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>•	Increased heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
                    <li>•	Redistribution of blood supply from the skin and intestines to the muscles.</li>
                    <li>•	Increased breathing rate (to increase oxygen supply). </li>
                    <li>•	Increased glucose secretion by the liver (for energy).</li>
                    <li>•	Dilation of the pupils (so the eyes can take in as much light as possible).</li>
                    <li>•	Suppression of functions that are not immediately essential in order to conserve energy (such as digestion and sexual drive) and which can be delayed without damage to the organism. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note">I would say remember three of these.</p>
                
                <p>When a threat is perceived, a signal is sent to the hypothalamus via the <a href="http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-amygdala-definition-role-function.html">amygdala</a>. It responds to the stressor by by activating the sympathetic nervous system, which then stimulates the adrenal medulla. This is the inner part of the adrenal gland, located about each kidney, which secretes catecholamines(hormones) into the bloodstream. Two of these hormones are <i>adrenaline</i> and <i>noradrenaline</i>, stress hormones that circulate in the bloodstream resulting in bodily changes that characterise the fight and flight reactions. The flight-fight reactions will enable one to fight harder, run faster, see better and breathe easier.</p>
                
                <p>Once the stressor is removed, the parasympathetic becomes dominant, and high body arousal subsides.</p>
                
                <p class="note">Basically, the hypothalamus receives a signal when a threat is seen, the sympathetic nervous system kicks in, and allows the person to extert themselves more.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Freeze Reactions</h4>
                
                <p>A freeze reaction occurs when faced with a threat that is so overwhelming that there is little or no chance of successfully fighting or escaping.</p>
                
                <p>Body movements and vocalisations stop, the racing eart slows down significantly, blood pressure drops and tense muscles collapse and become very still. Usually, there is a relexive 'oruenting response' of the head or eyes to the direction of the threat, accompanied by hypervigilance(Being on guard, watchful or extremely alert). This inital part of the freeze response acan be described as 'stop, look and listen' behaviour in response to fear.</p>
                
                <p>It is believed that this is done to assess the situation before making a next move. However some psychologists believe that this is not a true freeze state because the mind can become numb during a freeze state.</p>
                
                <p>The immobility of the freeze state is considered to have some adaptive value, as  prey that remain 'frozen' during a threat are more likely to avoid detection. The freeze state can also conserve energy, to be used for escape later. However it is not always adaptive, when the freeze reaction occurs during a non-threatening fearful event(eg. Freezing during a job interview)</p>
                
                
                <p>The biological processes underlying the freeze state are not completely understood. It is believed that sympathetic nervous system activation always precedes the freeze state and becomes part of this state. When the freeze reaction is initated the energy conserving 'rest and relaxation' actions of the parasympathetic nervous system dominate over the existing effects of the sympathetic activation. This leaves the organism in a state of high arousal of both the sympathetic and parasympatheic systems, allowing the organism to both conserve energy and be ready for action. </p>
                
                <p class="note">Jeepers that's a lot of content. Basically, when an organism can't fight or run away, they enter the freeze state. The state allows the organism to assess their situation by stimulating both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Role of Cortisol</h4>
                
                <p>To deal with a stressor over a prolonged the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal) axis is activated, a brain-body pathway, as the body cannot maintain the flight-fight reactions for a pronlonged period of time. The hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland, which in turn secretes hormones, such as ACTH, which is carried to the adrenal cortex. This stimulates the release of corticosteroids, which are stress hormones. The most abundant of these hormones is Cortisol.</p>
                
                <p>Cortisol's main effect is to energise the body by increasing energy supplies such as blood sugar and enhancing metabolism. Cortisol also has an anti-inflamitory effect, by blocking the activity of white blood cells. However it also slows wound healing, overall suppressing the activity of the immune system.</p>
                
                <p>The HPA axis takes significantly longer then the flight-fight-freeze response(Seconds to minutes) and persists for much londer(minutes to hours), but has an overall effect simmilar to that of the fight or flight reactions. </p>
                
                <p>High levels of cortisol over a prolonged period have the effect of impared immune system functioning, physical health problems and some mental disorders.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome</h4>
                
                <p><strong>The General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)</strong> is a three-stage physiological response to stress that occurs regardless of the stressor that is encountered. This means that the GAS is non-specific and will occur whatever the source of the stressor. As shown in figure 3.24, the GAS consists of three stages: an alarm reaction stage (with shock and counter shock), a stage of resistance and a stage of exhaustion.</p>

                                    <p>When the organism first becomes aware of the stressor the body goes into a temporary state of <i>shock</i> and its ability to deal with a stressor below its normal level. Physically, the body acts as if it was injured, as blood pressure and body temperature drop, and a temporary loss of muscle tone is experienced. The body rebounds from this level with a reaction called <i>countershock</i>. During this reaction the sympathetic nervous system is activated and the body's resistance to a stressor increases, as the organsim undergoes a fight-flight response. The inital stage of GAs is a general defensive reaction to the stressor, and results in a state of tension and alertness, and a readiness to respond to the stressor.</p>

                                    <p>If the source of the stressor is not dealt with immediately, and the state of stress continues, eneergy is still required and the body will continue responding in order to cope with and adapt to the stressor. The bodies resistance to the particular stressor rises above normal. The intense arousal of the alarm reaction stage diminishes, but physiological arousal remains at a level above normal. Since the body is being taxed to generate resistance, all unnecessary physiological processes are shut down. Generally, if the effort to deal with the initial stressor during the resistance stage is successful, the organism will have adapted to the stressor and the body eventually returns to its normal ‘balanced’ (homeostatic) state of functioning.</p>

During this stage, some alarm reaction changes may reappear, but the body cannot sustain its resistance and the effects of the stressor can no longer be dealt with. The organism's resistance to disease is weak, and it becomes more vulnerable to phyical and mental disorders. More commonly, the exhaustion stage brings about signs of physical wear and tear, especially in organs that have been consistently trying to deal with the stressor throughout the resistance stage.</p>

                <p>Selye's three stage GAS model of physiological responses to stress extended the findings of the flight-fight response, and further developed the links between stress and disease. The model also identifies biological processes associated with the body's stress response, such as the role in the GAS of the endocrine system. The model also identifies that the body can run out of resources to a persitent stressor, and become increasingly vulnerable.</p>
                
                <p>However the GAS is a 'one size fits all' model, and assumes that everyone will have the same gernal, predictable and automatic physiological responses to any kind of stressor. Consequencely, the GAS does not attempt to explain individual differences in terms of a response to a stressor. GAS tends to understate the roles of bodily systems other than the endocrine system, and does not address cognitive aspects of the stress response. Finally the GAS has been criticised for being primarily based on the results of research with animals.</p>
