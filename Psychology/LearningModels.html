            <h4 class="page-header">Learning</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Learning</strong> is defined as a relatively permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of experience. It is an ongoing process that continues throughout the lifespan, allowing the ability to asapt and cope in a changing enviroment.</p>

            <p>Learning can occur intentionally or unintentionally, and can be active or passive, and is defined as <i>relatively permanent</i> due to it not having to produce a permanent lifelong change.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Conditioning</strong> is the process of learning associations between a stimulus in the enviroment and a behavioural response, and has two main types, Classical and operant.</p>
            
            <!-- Classical Conditioning (Pg. 221 - 229) -->	
            
            <h4 class="page-header">Classical Conditioning</h4>
			
			<p>Also known as <i>Respondent Conditioning</i>, <strong>Classical Conditioning</strong> refers to a type of learning that occurs through the repeated association of two or more different stimuli. Learning is said to only have taken place when a stimulus consistently produces a response that it did not previously produce. Learning results from the involuntary linking of this stimulus, over a number of trials, with a stimulus that normally produces the response automatically. In Classical Conditioning, a <strong>stimulus</strong> is any object or event that elicits a response from an organism. A <strong>response</strong> is a reaction by an organism to a stimulus.</p>
			
			<p>Classical Conditioning is often described as a three phrase learning process - Before conditioning, during conditioning and after conditioning. These terms are described by the following five key terms:</p>

			<p>During classical conditioning,each paired presentation of the NS with the UCS is reffered to as a <i>trial</i>. The term <i>acquistion</i> is used to describe the overall process during which an orgranism learns to associate two events. During acquistion, the NS and UCS should be presented close together in time, and always in the same seqeuence. The duration of the acquisition stage is measured by the number of trials it takes for the CR to be learned, and is often very fast early in the acquistion period.</p>
			
			<p>The NS should be shown before the UCS and there should be a very shory time between their presentations, no more than half a second. The longer the time interval, the less effective it is to establish a link.</p>  
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Stimulus Gerneralisation</h4>
			
			<p><strong>Stimulus Generalisation</strong> is the tendency for another stimulus that is similar to the original CS to produce a response that is similar, but always identical, to the CR. The greater the similarity between stimuli, the greater the possibility that a generalisation will occur. While stimulus generalisation is rarely an intentional or even a conscious process, it has a valuable adaptive role, but can become maladaptive depending on the context.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Stimulus Discrimination</h4>
			
			<p>In classical conditioning, stimulus discrimination occurs when an organism responds to the CS only, but not to any other stimulus that is similar to the CS.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Extinction</h4>
			
			<p>A conditioned reponse is not necessarily permanent. The strength of the association may fade over time or dissapear altogether. <strong>Extinction</strong> is the gradual decrease in the strength or rate of a CR that occurs when the UCS is no longer presented. It is said to have occured when a CR no longer occurs following presentation of the CS. The rate at which Extinction occurs varries, but in general, the more complex the behaviour pattern, the longer it will take.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Spontaneous Recovery</h4>
			
			<p>Extinction of a conditoned response is not always permanent. <strong>Spontaneous Recovery</strong> is the reappearance of a CR when the CS is presented, following a rest period after the CR apperas to have been extinguished. It does not always occur, and tends to be short lived and weaker then the inital response. If extinction is repeated several times, spontaneous recovery will not occur.</p>
			
			<p class="note">These definitions are for Classical Conditioning, and are different in terms of operant conditioning.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Little Albert</h4>
			
			<p>An emotional reaction in response to a specific stimulus can be learnt through classical conditioning, called a <strong>conditioned emotional response</strong>. This occurs when the autonomic nervous system produces a reaction to a stimulus that it previously didn't. This can be used to develop harmful maladaptive fears, as illustrated by the Little Albert Experiment.</p>
			
			<p>The experiment was designed to test the belief that fears can be acquired through classical conditioning, through the use of a sole human participant, Albert B. (Little Albert). The infant was particulary docile, and did not regularly cry, making it an excellent candidate for the experiment. After testing him to ensure he could develop a fear response, the experiment began.</p>
			
			<p>Albert was placed on a mattress in a room where a white laboratory rat (CR) was placed within reaching distance. Albert showed no inital fear, and happily played with the animal. As Albert was playing with the white rat, one of the experimenters distracted him, while the other stood behind Albert and struck a hammer against a suspended steel bar, causing a loud noice (UCS), that started Albert, causing flailing of his limbs and shortened increased breath sounds. These reactions grew more pronounced and intense in nature as this was further repeated, on the third round reducing Albert to tears.</p>
				
			<p>Encouraged by this, a further series of fear-conditioning procedures was conducted with Albert, held irregulary over a 17-day period. Where the following experimental procedures were followed:</p>
			
			<p>White rat was taken from basket and presented to Albert, he reaches for the rat with his left hand, and just as he touches the animal, the bar was struck imediately above Alberts head. This caused him to jump violently, and to bury his head in the mattress. As he reached out with his right hand, the bar was struck again, causing him to fall and whimper. One week later, this was repeated again until 7 pairings were made. Albert showing a distinct fear response (CR) in response to the rat (CS) being placed near him. The researchers discovered that Alberts nearly acquired fear response also generalised to other stimuli that were similar to the rat, such as a white fluffy dog.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Ethical Implications of the Experiment</h4>
			
			<p>Albert was never removed of his conditioned emotional responses by the inital reasearches, and it is believed that the mother was not fully aware of the experiment, and how her son was to be used. This violates <strong>informed consent</strong>. It is also not clear if Albert was given clear <strong>withdrawal rights</strong>, and notes from the experiment suggest that Albert was possibl not a suitable research participant. Albert would have also experienced considerable emotional harm, violating <strong>beneficence</strong>. Because of this, this experiment is considered unethical by modern standards.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Operant Conditioning</h4>
			
			<p>Operant Conditioning is a type of learning whereby the consequences of behaviour determine the likelihood that it will be performed again in the future. Operant conditioning proposes that an organism will repeat a behaviour that has desirable consquences, or avoid undesirable consequences.</p>
			
			<p>An <strong>Operant</strong> is any response that operates on the enviroment to produce some kind of consequence. Positive consequences strengthen the behaviour and make it more likely to recur and adverse consequences weaken the behaviour and make it less likely to recur. Since the consequence occurs in the environment, the environment determines whether or not the operant occurs. Unlike classical conditioning, operant conditioning involes <strong>voluntary responses</strong>.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Operant Conditioning as a Three-Phase Model</h4>
			
			<p>This model states that all behaviour can be analysed and explained by the relationship between the behaviour, its antecedents and its consequences. This three way relationship is called the three-phase model of operant conditioning.</p>
			
			<p>The three phase model of operant conditioning has three parts that occur in a specific sequence, which are:</p>
			
			<ol>
			
				<li>Antecdent - A stimulus that occurs before the behaviour.</li>
				<li>The Behaviour - That occurs due to the antecedent.</li>
				<li>The Consequence - To the behaviour.</li>
				
			</ol>
			
			<p>Anything in the organism's enviroment can be an antecedent, and are already in place before any behaviour occurs. When an antecedent does influence the likelihood of specific behaviour occursing, it is called an antecedent stimulus. The antecedent stimulus must be present for the relevant behaviour to occur. Through its association with a consequence, the antecedent stimulus signals whether certain behaviour will lead to a particular consequence. The antecedent stimulus is sometimes referred to as the antecent condition to emphasise that it occurs before the relevant behaviour.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Behaviour</strong> is the voluntary action that occurs in the presence of the antecedent stimulus. It may be one specific action or a pattern of actions. In all cases, it involves activity that has an efect on the enviroment in the form of a consequence that follows it.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Consequence</strong> is the enviromental event that occurs immediately after the behvaiour and has an effect on the occurrence of the bahviour. Any behaviour which is followed by a consequence will change in strength (become more, or less, established) and frequency (occur more, or less, often) depending on the nature of that consequence (reward or punishment). Behaviour that is followed by a reward strengthens the behaviour and makes it more likely to occur again, whereas behaviour followed by punishment weakens the behaviour and makes it less likely to occur again.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Reinforcers</h4>
			
			<p>Reinforcement is said to occur when a stimulus strengthens or increases the frequency of a response that follows. This may invoilve using a postive stimulus, or a removing a negative one. An essential feature of reinforcement is that it is only used <i>after</i> the desired response is made. A reinforcer is any stimulus that increases the frequency of a response that follows. Reinforcer and reward are used interchangeably.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Positive Reinforcer</h4>
			
			<p>A positive reinforcer is a stimulus that increases the frequency of a desired response by providing a satisfying consequence. <strong>Positive Reinforcement</strong> involves giving a positive reinforcer after the desired response has been made.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Negative Reinforcer</h4>
			
			<p>A negative reinforcer is any unpleasnt stimulus that whe removed or avioided, increases the frequency of a desired response. <strong>Negative Reinforcement</strong> involves the removal or avoidance of an unpleasant stimulus. It has the effect of increasing the likelihood of a response being repeated, strengthing the reponse. An important distinction between positive and negative reinforcement is that positive reinforcers are given and negative reinforcers are removed or avoided. </p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Punishment</h4>
			
			<p><strong>Punishment</strong> is the delivery of an unpleasant consequence following a response, or the removal of a pleasant consequence following a response. Punishment has the same unpleasant quality as a negative reinforcer, but unlike a negative reinforcer, the punishment is given or applied, whereas the negative reinforcer is prevented or avoided. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Positive Punishment</strong> involves the presentation of a stimulus, thereby decreasing the likelihood of a response occuring again. <strong>Negative Punishment</strong> involves the removal of a stimulus and thereby decreasing the likelihood of a response occuring again. In both positive and negative punishment, the intended effect on the punished behaviour is to weaken and prevent it from recurring. </p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Response Cost</h4>
			
			<p>Since negative punishment involves taking a stimulus away as a consequence of a particular response, it is often referred to as response cost. Reponse cost may be described as involving removal of any valued stimulus, whether or not it causes the behaviour. There is a cost for making a response, therefore 'response cost'.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Stimulus Generalisation</h4>
			
			<p>Occurs when the correct response is made to another stimulus that is similar to the stimulus that was present when the conditioned response was reinforced. The response usually occurs at a reduced level.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Stimulus Discrimination</h4>
			
			<p>Occurs when an organism makes the correct response to a stimulus, even when stimuli are similar (but not identical).</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Extinction</h4>
			
			<p>The gradual decrease in stength of a conditioned response following consistent non-reinforcement of the response. Extinction is said to have occurred when a conditioned response is no longer present. Extinction occurs over time after reinforcement is no longer present.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Spontaneous Recovery</h4>
			
			<p>After extinction, the organism can once again show the response in the absence of any reinforcement. This response is likely to be weaker and will not last as long. A spontaneously recovered response is often stronger when it occurs after a lengthy period following extinction of the response than when it occurs relatively soon after extinction.</p>
			
			<p class="note">I'd like to say that about half of the words in this chapter are literally just synonyms. This book really likes to assert its point by repeating synonyms next to each other, over and over again until there are hundreds of stupid words, unlike that of chum which is a jolly spiffing exceptional word frienderinoo.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Observational Learning</h4>
			
			<p class="note">It's learning through observing whats to know my jolly good chum there my sir.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Observational Learning</strong> occurs when someone uses observation of a model's actions and the consequences of those actions to guide their future actions. A <strong>model</strong> is who or what is being observed, and may be live or symbolic. As observational learning involves watching models, it is often called modelling. </p>
			
			<p>Social Learning theory emphasises the importance of the enviroment, or 'social context', in which learning occurs. Bandura proposed that from the time we are born we are surrounded by other people displaying a huge variety or behaviours, all of which can be observed. Observational learning involves being conditioned indirectly, by observing someone else's conditioning. During <strong>Vicarious Conditioning</strong>, the individual watches a model's behaviour being either reinforced or punished, and then subsequently behaves in exactly the same way, or a modified way. Vicarious versions of each type of operant conditioning are literally just the definition, except you're watching someone else do it instead of it happening to you. A mental representation must also be stored in memory of what was observed so that it is available for reproduction if the learner chooses to do so. Social learning was renamed social cognitive theory, to confuse you chum, and is considered to be the gap between operant and classical conditioning.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Observational Learning Processes</h4>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Attention</h4>
			
			<p>To learn through observation, one must pay attention to a model's behaviour and the consequences. Attention can be influenced by perceptual capabilites of the observer, the motivation and interest level of the observer, the situation in which the behaviour is being observed, the kinds of distracters that are present and the characteristics of the model, such as attractiveness.</p>
			
			<p>In general, the greater the similarity between the model and the observer, and the more attractive or successful the model, the more likely we are to follow their example. </p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Retention</h4>
			
			<p>After observing the model, you have to remember the behaviour. Behaviour learned is often not needed until much later, requiring it to be stored in memory properly.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Reproduction</h4>
			
			<p>When a model's behaviour has been closely watched, and retained in memory, one can attempt to reproduce what has been observed. To do this, you must be able to have the ability to properly reproduce the behaviour.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Motivation</h4>
			
			<p class="note">I'll take two please</p>
			
			<p>The observer must also be motivated to perform the behaviour, and must want to reproduce what was observed.</p>
			
			<h4 class="page-header">Reinforcement</h4>
			
			<p>Reinforcement influences the motivation to reproduce the observed behaviour and increases the likelihood of reproduction. <strong>External Reinforcement</strong> is compareable to learning by consequences.<strong>Vicarious Reinforcement</strong> occurs indirectly by observing the modelled behaviour being reinforced with personally experiencing the reinforcement. <strong>Self-reinforcement</strong> occurs when we are reinforced by meeting certain standards of performance we set for ourselves.</p>
			
			<p>If the modelled behaviour is reinforced, this will motivate the person to repeat those actions; the next time, the person will expect the behaviour to be reinforced.</p>
