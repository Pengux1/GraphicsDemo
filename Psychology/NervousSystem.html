      <h4 class="page-header">Conscious and Unconscious Responses to Stimuli</h4>

      <p>Simply enough, a <strong>Conscious Response</strong> to a stimulus is a reaction that involves awareness. You will have paid attention to the stimulus and therefore know about it, and therefore can be described as voluntary and goal directed, thus allowing for some kind of control over it.</p>
      <p>Shockingly, an <strong>Unconscious Response</strong> to a stimulus is a reaction that does not involve aweness.It is involuntary, unintentional, automatic and we cannot ordinarily control its occurrence. Bodily responses regulated by the ANS occur automatically without conscious effort, many of which are reflexive responses. </p>

      <h4 class="page-header">Spinal Reflex</h4>
      <p>A spinal reflex is an unconscious, involuntary and automatically occurring response to certain stimuli without any involvement of the brain. It is often referred to as a reflex arc because the response to an incoming stimulus is automatically ‘reflected back’ from the spinal cord without any initial input from the brain and before the brain processes a conscious perception of the stimulus. </p>
      <p>Absence of various spinal reflexes can indicate neural disorders.</p>
      <p>The spinal reflex demonstrates that a response to a particular sensory stimulus can have both an unconscious and conscious component, one occurring before the other.</p>

      <!-- Neurons -->

      <h4 class="page-header">Role of the Neuron</h4>
      <p>A neuron is an individual nerve cell that is specialised to receive, process and/or transmit information. Neurons not only communicate with each other, but also with muscles and glands. The entire nervous system is comprised of neurons organised into networks that form neural circuits and pathways of varying complexity through which information is continuously transmitted. They carry information in the form of an <i>action potential</i>, either sending it to the appropirate part of the nervous system, or interpreting the message, enabling a response.</p>

Most dendrites have little protrusions, or ‘outgrowths’, called dendritic spines. Each spine provides a site with receptors where a neuron can connect with and receive information from a neighbouring neuron. The neuron’s capability to form (‘grow’) new dendritic spines is associated with and demonstrates neuroplasticity. When the dendrites receive information from other neurons, they pass it on to the neuron’s soma (cell body) where it is integrated. The soma may collect and integrate information from thousands of other neurons. Once the incoming information from other neurons has been integrated in the soma, it is transmitted along the axon. </p>

      <!-- Neurotransmitters -->

      <h4 class="page-header">Role of Neurotransmitters</h4>
      <p>Neurons communicate with each other by sending neurotransmitter across the tiny space between the terminal buttons of one neuron, and the dendrites of the other, called the synaptic gap. The synaptic gap is a component of the synapse, the site where communication occurs betwen to adjacent neurons.</p>

      <p>Neurotransmitter is a chemical substance produced by a neuron that carries a message to other neurons or cless in muscles, organs or other tissue. Neurotransmitters work by binding to receptor sites of postsynaptic neurons that are specialised to recieve that spcific neurotransmitter. A neurotransmitter that does not bind to the recpetors in the postsynaptic neuron is reabsorbed into the neuron by a process called <i>reuptake.</i></p>

      <p>Generally, a neurotransmitter will wither <strong>excite</strong> or <strong>inhibit</strong> neuron firing. <i>Glutamate</i> is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, making postsynaptic neurons more likely to fire. It is associated with enhanced learning and memory. <i>GABA</i> is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, making neurons less likely to fire. GABA works to to control and fine tune neuron firing, to prevent it from getting out of control.</p>

      <p>Neurotransmitters only fit to certain receptors through a <strong>lock and key process</strong>, where a neurotransmitters shape must match the shape of the receptor site, allowing the neurotransmitters specific function to occur.</p>
      <p class="note">This is specifically referenced in the study design, so know this.</p>

      <!-- Parkinsons -->

      <h4 class="page-header">Parkinson's Disease</h4>
      <p>Parkinson's is a CNS neurodegenerative disorder characterised by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Motor symptoms result from the degeneration of the <i>substantia nigra</i> located in the midbrain, the site at which dopamine is produced in the brain. Dopamine from the substantia nigra carries messages on how to control body movements, and thus diminished levels of it are  responsible for most of the symptoms of this disease.</p>
      <p>Four key symptoms are used for diagnosis of Parkinsons. These are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>•	Tremor</strong> - Continuous, involuntary shaking.</li>
        <li><strong>•	Muscle Rigidity</strong> - Muscles are unable to relax, and are tight, even at rest.</li>
        <li><strong>•	Slowness of Voluntary Movement(Bradykinesia)</strong> - Particually when initating and executing movement, and in performing repetitive movements. Also a decrease in fine motor coordination, such as being able to do up buttons on a shirt.</li>
        <li><strong>•	Postural Instability, Balance Problems and Gait (Walking) disturbances</strong> - Inability to maintain a steady, upright posture or to take a corrective action to prevent a fall often results in just that — falling. Gait disturbance is apparent in the short, shuffling steps taken by individuals and reduced arm swing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There is no known cure for Parkinsons, but motor symptoms can be relieved by by medications that restore the deficiency of dopamine by increasing its level in the brain. Two types of medication can be used, those that can be converted into dopamine by neurons(Levodopa), and those that mimic the role of dopamine(Bromocriptine, Pramipexole, and Ropinirole). These medications however, provide diminishing effects over time, requiring higher and higher doses to be effective, and can have severe side effects, particularly at higher doses. In some cases, Deep Brain Stimulation may be an option, working by placing an electrode in the basal ganglia(Controls motor function), that essentially works as a filter, stopping excess muscle movement.</p>
      <p class="note">Treatment and Symptoms are not explicitly mentioned in the study design, so don't try too hard to memorise this.</p>

      <p>There is growing evidence that the midbrain dopamine neurons also release GABA, meaning that there is a reduced level of GABA in the brains of those with Parkinsons. It is belived that dopamine therapy is not completely effective due to the diminished level of GABA not being addressed.</p>
      <p class="note">This is implicitly mentioned in the study design, so <strong>remember this!</strong></p>
